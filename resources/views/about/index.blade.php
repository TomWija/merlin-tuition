	<p>As a teacher I know that every student is different and
        finding the correct tutor for you can be a struggle. With
        this in mind I setup merlintuition to find the very best
        tutors in the area. We meet all of our tutors personally to
        ensure that they are up to the standard of tuition which we
        expect. We also know that personality can make a huge
        difference and so we try to get to know our tutors so that
        we can pick the perfect tutor and student matches.</p>
		<br>
	<p>We are always seeking out the best tutors within Brighton to
        provide you with the best possible match.</p>

	<h1 class="text-center vertical-gutters--large">Our Ethos</h1>
    <p>Education can be an amazing experience, but it can also bring
    with it stress, especially if you do not get on with your
    teacher/tutor. To this end we try to ensure that your tutor
    is not only exceptional at their subject, but brings interest
    and enthusiasm to their sessions.</p>
	<br>
    <p>We believe that one of the most important parts of education
    is passion. If you enjoy a subject then it is far easier to
    learn it and so all of our tutors are passionate about their
    subjects and bring this passion to their students.</p>
	<br>
    <p>From this passion the students understanding grows and the
    grades come from this.</p>
